            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Collaboration with <strong>MIT</strong> and <strong>Amazon Web Services</strong>, this summer camp is all about empowering young women.
                Led by women in engineering, including myself, we taught classes that brought <strong>computational thinking</strong>, <strong>software engineering</strong>, and <strong>coding</strong> to life. <br>
                Through hands-on learning in algorithms, problem-solving, and coding, we inspired participants to see the endless possibilities of learning, growth, and innovation.

            <h2>Why This Project Matters</h2>
            <p>
                This project was about <strong>creating opportunities</strong> for young women in STEM and making a real impact on them.
                By fostering a supportive environment led by passionate women engineers, we empowered participants to see their <strong>potential</strong> in technology and beyondâ€”anything they could dream of, really.<br>
                The program was more than learning skills; it was about planting a seed of confidence, and showing that women belong at the forefront of innovation.
            </p>
